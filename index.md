# Welcome to my page!
Here is a postgraduate student of linguistics, majoring in dialect and experimental phonetics.
I'm a starter so I'm just trying to share some simple things here:
- Knowledge of linguistics, especially phonetics and dialects of Chinese.
- Tool usage in my academic and daily life.
- Notes of learning processing. (Praat Script, Python and R, etc..)
- Photos taken by myself & watercolor paintings.
- Other essays.

Still learning to use Github... Hope that I can keep this habbit!
